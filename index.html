        <about>
            <p>I am an undergraduate at Purdue University majoring in Robotics Engineering Technology. I am passionate about learning, and I love to tackle new challenges. I started with hobby programming and moved on to competitive robotics. As the lead programmer for my highschool team, we broke international records and placed 2nd at the Vex World Championships. The success I achieved influenced me to choose engineering for my career path. Currently I am the software lead for the Purdue ACM SIGbots robotics team, and a freelance programmer in my free time.</p>
